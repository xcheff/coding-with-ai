Re: Complaint against eFone
    
I have been charged the incorrect amount for my internet usage. My contract states I have an allowance per month, but I am being charged daily for each separate connection to the internet.
    
I enclose a cheque to cover the part of the bill which isn’t disputed.
    
send me a revised bill and explain why I have been charged extra in this way.
    
I understand you have 8 weeks to resolve my complaint before I can go to the telecommunications ombudsman. If we haven’t agreed a resolution about my complaint before the 8 weeks have lapsed, I will request a deadlock letter from you and take my complaint to a telecommunications ombudsman.
    
I first contacted you about this on 22 October 2022. This was by email. I have calculated that the 8 weeks will have lapsed on 17 December 2022.
    
Yours faithfully,
    
Pete Hoolin
